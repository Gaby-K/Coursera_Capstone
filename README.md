Introduction

Problem :  accidents always happen suddenly and people have no choice but to deal with those unexpected incidents without any preparation.  If there is a machine learning model can predict and warn people in advance, then people can drive more carefully or change their travel plan beforehand instead of rushing into  or being affected by some accidents.  

Background discussion:  In recent news, there were several car accidents causing severe traffic jams.  Whether or not people involved in those accidents  were unprepared and affected by those accidents, such as cancellation of their important meetings, holiday plan, and so on. Therefore,  the prediction of accident severity will expect to be a very helpful topic to study.

Data:  I will use the shared data in this course.  The data with many observations (rows) for predicting accident “severity” will be very helpful.  I plan to find the relationship between severity and other factors
Label: accident "severity”
Features: there are 37 attributes in columns, which can be used to predict accident severity.

How:  Following the process of CRISP-DM, I will explore and clean the dataset, and then determine which attributes to be used for training my machine learning model.  Per my preliminary exploratory, I will use 17 out of 37 attributes to train my ML model (may be much less after I access the condition of those chosen ones by examining patterns, correlations, skewed information, etc.)Afterwards, I will start the process of modeling and evaluation by using train-test split method and other accuracy measurement metrics.   Finally, I will report my solution  to avoid impact of traffic when future accident happens
