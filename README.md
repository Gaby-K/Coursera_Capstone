<b>Introduction</b>

<b>Problem:</b>  accidents always happen suddenly, and people have no choice but to deal with those unexpected incidents without any preparation.  If there is a machine learning model can predict and warn people, then people can drive more carefully or change their travel plan beforehand instead of rushing into or being affected by some accidents.  

<b>Background discussion:</b>  In recent news, several car accidents were causing severe traffic jams.  Whether or not people involved in those accidents were unprepared and affected by those accidents, such as cancellation of their important meetings, holiday plan, etc. Therefore,  the prediction of accident severity will expect to be a beneficial topic to study.
Objective:  To avoid the impact of traffic when a future accident happens

<b>Data:</b> I will use the shared data in this course.  The data with many observations (rows) for predicting accident "severity" will be beneficial.  I plan to find the relationship between severity and other factors.
* Label: accident "severity."
* Features: use 37 attributes to predict accident severity.

<b>How:</b>  Following the process of CRISP-DM, I will explore and clean the dataset, and then determine to use which attributes for training my machine learning model.  Per my preliminary exploratory, I will use 17 out of 37 attributes to train my ML model, such as weather, road condition, light condition, and so on (maybe much less after I access the condition of those chosen ones by examining patterns, correlations, skewed information, etc.) Afterwards, I will start the process of modeling and evaluation by using the train-test split method and other accuracy measurement metrics.   Finally, I will report my solution to avoid the impact of traffic when a future accident happens
